Hi, I’m @TravisZovko.
- I'm an aspiring game developer interested in pursuing a career in game design or gameplay programming.
- My current self-study consists of making small game projects (paper and digital), participating in open online courses, and supplementing my practice with books and online resources.
- Most of my programming experience is with C#, and I'd like to learn more C++.
- In the future, I'd like to return to school to pursue a degree in computer science.

Outside of game development, I like to spend my time reading, cooking, playing games, and hiking.
